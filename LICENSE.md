The code is released under GPL v3, but an extra term is added to ensure any contributors to the game are credited in game:

*Derivative works must display the following list of credits at an appropriate point during the running of the executable.  In version 1 this happens on the game menu and game end screen but any reasonable variation is fine.  Other contributors are invited to add themselves to this list (both in-game and in this license) as appropriate.*

*“Original concept & development: Crispin Cooper”*

The level designs, graphics, music and embedded sounds are released under CC Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 Intl.
Note that levels with the NASA backdrop must also comply with CC Attribution as they currently do, and the Exo-Bold font is covered by the SIL Open Font License v1.10.
